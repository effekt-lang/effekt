# Îž Effekt

Compared to other languages with effect handlers (and support for polymorphic effects) the Effekt language
aims to be significantly more lightweight in its concepts.


## Disclaimer: Use at your own risk

**Effekt is a research-level language. We are actively working on it and the language (and everything else) is very likely to change.**

Also, Effekt comes with no warranty and there are (probably) many bugs -- If this does not discourage you, feel free to
play with it and give us your feedback :)
